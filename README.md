# cmpe591-hw3

In this homework, I initially trained SAC and VPG with the previous reward function, the one in the "_homework3.py" because of a misunderstanding.

Later, I did with the newest reward function. However, I faced an issue: Because of some worker issue, my new version of VPG died just before saving the rewards. 

**IMPORTANT**

Therefore, my VPG reward calculations below will have the plot and model from the "_homework3.py"s environment and my SAC will have my newly defined "my_hw3" environment.
